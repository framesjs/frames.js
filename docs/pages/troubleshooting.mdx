# Troubleshooting

## Image not rendering

### Image too large

If the image is not rendering, it may be too large.

- If you are including a full size external `<img>` element, consider passing the external image as a string instead:

```tsx
return {
  image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
};
```

- Try resizing it to a smaller size via the `imageOptions` of the returned `FrameDefinition`.

```tsx
return {
  image: <div>...</div>,
  imageOptions: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
  },
};
```

### Image wrong format

If the image is not rendering, it may be in the wrong format. SVG images are typically not supported on mobile.

## Initial frame not loading

Ensure that the `fetchMetadata` URL is correct and that it is inside the `other` property for Next.js.

### `VERCEL_URL` environment variable

If you are using Vercel, the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable is not a fully qualified URL and may cause issues with `fetchMetadata`. You will have to prepend the protocol to `VERCEL_URL`.

```tsx
export async function generateMetadata() {
  const frameMetadata = await fetchMetadata(
    new URL(
      "/frames",
      process.env.VERCEL_URL
        ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
        : "http://localhost:3000"
    )
  );

  return {
    title: "My page",
    other: {
      ...frameMetadata,
    },
  };
}
```

### Vercel authentication

When deploying to Vercel, your site will not automatically be accessible to the public. You will need to disable Vercel Authentication under your project's `Settings > Deployment Protection > Vercel Authentication` on vercel.com.

## Import type errors

If you are getting type errors when importing `frames.js`, you may need to change the `moduleResolution` in your `tsconfig.json` from `node` to `nodenext`.

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext"
  }
}
```

## Unable to access frame message on initial frame

The initial frame is accessed via a GET request and does not have access to frame message and hence user data.

## Type error: Route ... does not match the required types of a Next.js Route

If you are getting this error you are exporting something other than a Next.js route from a `route.tsx` or `page.tsx` file.

We recommend creating a new file for your `frames` app and importing it in the routes that use it.

### Example

Frames app file

```tsx [frames.ts]
import { createFrames } from "frames.js/next";

export const frames = createFrames({
  basePath: "/frames",
});
```

Initial page route

```tsx [route.tsx]
import { frames } from "./frames";

export const GET = frames(async (ctx) => {
  // ctx.message is not available in the initial frame
  return {
    image: <div>...</div>,
    buttons: [
      <Button action="post" target="/my-route">
        Next
      </Button>,
    ],
  };
});
```

Frame action handler route

```tsx [my-route/route.tsx]
import { frames } from "../frames";

export const POST = frames(async (ctx) => {
  // Do something with ctx.message
  // ...

  return {
    image: <div>...</div>,
    buttons: [
      // ...
    ],
  };
});
```

## TypeError: Invalid URL ... when calling Next.js route

If you are getting this error you are possibly running your app behind multiple proxies. Next.js receives multiple `x-forwarded-proto` and `x-forwarded-host` headers which causes the URL to be invalid.

We recommend downgrading to `next@14.0.1` as this is the last version that does not have this issue and works with `frames.js`. See https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/issues/319 and https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/58914.

## Combining old and new SDKs

You cannot use the `<FrameComponent>`, `<FrameButton>` and `<FrameImage>` components from the old SDK (`frames.js/next/server`) with the new SDK (`frames.js/next`).

The new SDK uses a [`FrameDefinition`](/reference/core/createFrames#framedefinition) object to define a frame.
