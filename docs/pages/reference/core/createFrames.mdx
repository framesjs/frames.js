# createFrames

`createFrames()` creates a function which accepts your frames handler and returns a request handler.

Usually you shouldn't use this function directly but rather use one of our adapters based on a framework you are using, e.g. [Express.js](/reference/core/express), [Hono](/reference/core/hono), [Next.js](/reference/core/next) or [Remix](/reference/core/remix).

```tsx
import { createFrames } from "frames.js/core";

const frames = createFrames();
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    image: <span>Test</span>,
  };
});
```

The function passed to `frames` will be called with the context of a frame action and should return a `FrameDefinition`.

## Parameters

`createFrames` accepts an optional options object with the following properties:

### `basePath`

- Type: `string`

A string that specifies the base path for all relative URLs in the frame definition. It defaults to `/`. If `baseUrl` is provided, it will be resolved relatively to `baseUrl`. If the `baseUrl` option is not provided, it will use URL of current request and override its path with `basePath` when generating target URLs.

### `baseUrl`

- Type: `string | URL`

A string or URL object that specifies the base URL for all relative URLs in the frame definition. Can be used to override the URL detected from the request.

### `debug`

- Type: `boolean`

Enables debug mode. Debug mode is necessary if you want to use image layout debugging in the debugger.

### `signingSecret`

- Type: `string`

If provided, frames state and image URL payloads will be signed with this secret and validated on subsequent requests.

Overridden by `stateSigningSecret` for state signing and `imagesSigningSecret` for signing images if provided.

### `imagesRoute`

- Type: `string | null`

Image rendering will be handled by this route. It defaults to `/` relative to the `basePath`.

The route must handle GET requests. It is recommended to use the initial frame route or any route that exports a `frames()` GET route handler.

Pass `null` to disable async image rendering and use inline data URLs instead.

### `imageRenderingOptions`

- Type `ImageWorkerOptions | () => Promise<ImageWorkerOptions>`

Options for the image renderer. If a function is provided, it will be called on each request to get the options.

### `imagesSigningSecret`

- Type: `string`

A secret key used to sign and verify the image URLs. If provided, image URLs are automatically signed with this key and verified on each request.

Overrides `signingSecret` for image signing if provided.

### `initialState`

- Type: generic

A JSON serializable value that is used if no state is provided in the message or you are on the initial frame.

### `stateSigningSecret`

- Type: `string`

A secret key used to sign and verify the state in the frame message. If provided, state is automatically signed with this key and verified on each frame.

- If the signature is present in state data:
  - If the secret is not provided, the state will not be verified and used as is.
  - If the secret is provided and signature does not match error is thrown.
  - If the secret is provided and signature matches, the state will be used as is.

Overrides `signingSecret` for state signing if provided.

### `middleware`

See the [Middleware guide](/guides/middleware) for more information.

Type: `FramesMiddleware`

An array of middleware functions that are called before the frame handler and allows you to inject additional context into the `ctx` parameter passed to each frame handler call.

Each middleware should return a promise that resolves to the next middleware, or a [Web API `Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), or a `FrameDefinition`.

#### Types

For strong type support in the handler, the middleware should be typed as `FramesMiddleware<any, YourContextType>`.

```tsx
import { createFrames, types } from "frames.js/next";

const myMiddleware: types.FramesMiddleware<any, { foo?: string }> = async (
  ctx,
  next
) => {
  return next({ foo: "bar" });
};
```

#### Example

```tsx [./app/frames/route.tsx]
const frames = createFrames({
  middleware: [
    async (ctx, next) => {
      console.log("Before frame handler");
      const result = await next({ name: "Alice" });
      console.log("After frame handler");
      return result;
    },
  ],
});

const handler = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    image: <span>{ctx.name}</span>, // Outputs an image with the text "Alice"
  };
});
```

## FrameDefinition

`FrameDefinition` is an object that describes a frame. It has the following properties:

### `image`

- Type: `React.ReactElement | string`

The image to be rendered in the frame. If a string is provided, it must be a valid URL.

### `imageOptions`

- Type: `{ aspectRatio?: "1.91:1" | "1:1" } & ConstructorParameters<typeof ImageResponse>[1]`

Options for the image. The `aspectRatio` property can be set to `"1.91:1"` or `"1:1"`.

### `buttons`

- Type: 1, 2, 3, or 4 `FrameButtonElement` elements

An array of buttons to be rendered in the frame. The buttons are rendered in the order they are provided.

#### Example

```tsx
import { Button } from "frames.js/next";

const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    image: <span>Test</span>,
    buttons: [
      <Button action="post">Post</Button>,
      <Button action="post_redirect">Post Redirect</Button>,
    ],
  };
});
```

### `textInput`

- Type: `string`

Label for text input. If no value is provided, the input is not rendered.

### `state`

- Type: `JsonValue`

Global app state that will be available on the next frame.

### `headers`

- Type: `HeadersInit`

Custom headers to be included in the response.

The `ResponseInit` properties allow you to specify custom headers such as `Cache-Control`.

### Cache-Control

If you wish to have dynamic content in your frame which is re-rendered on every feed reload, you can specify a low `Cache-Control` `max-age` value.

Here is an example of a frame definition with a `Cache-Control` header set to `max-age=0`. It will always show the current time in the user's feed.

```tsx
/* eslint-disable react/jsx-key */
import { Button } from "frames.js/next";
import { createFrames } from "frames.js/next";

const frames = createFrames();

const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    image: (
      <div tw="bg-purple-800 text-white w-full h-full justify-center items-center flex">
        The current time is {new Date().toLocaleString()}
      </div>
    ),
    imageOptions: {
      aspectRatio: "1:1",
    },
    buttons: [<Button action="post">Refresh</Button>],
    headers: {
      // [!code focus]
      // Max cache age in seconds // [!code focus]
      "Cache-Control": "max-age=0", // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
  };
});
```

## Request Handler

The resulting `handleRequest` is a function that accepts [Web API `Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and returns a Promise that resolves to [Web API `Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

```tsx
handleRequest(new Request("/")).then((res) => {
  return res.text();
});
```

### Per-route middleware

You can also pass middleware to the `handleRequest` function to be executed only for that specific route.

```tsx
const handleRequest = frames(
  async (ctx) => {
    return {
      image: <span>Test</span>,
    };
  },
  {
    middleware: [farcasterHubContext({ hubHttpUrl: process.env.HUB_HTTP_URL })],
  }
);
```

This will only execute the `farcasterHubContext` middleware for the route that `handleRequest` is called with.

## Context

Core middleware is included and executed by default and gives you access to the following default context in your frame handlers:

### `basePath`

- Type: `string`

Specifies the base path for all relative URLs in the frame definition.

### `baseUrl`

- Type: `URL`

The resolved base URL for all relative URLs in the frame definition. All relative URLs are resolved relatively to this value.

### `initialState`

- Type: generic

A JSON serializable value that is used if no state is provided in the message or you are on the initial frame.

### `request`

- Type: [Web API `Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)

The request object that was passed to the request handler.

### `url`

- Type: [Web API `URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

The URL object that was parsed from the request.

## `walletAddress`

- Type: `() => Promise<string | undefined>`

A function that returns the wallet address of the user. If the user is not authenticated or initial frame is being rendered, it returns `undefined`.

### `searchParams`

- Type: `Record<string, string>`

The search params in the URL as an object. If there are no search params, it will be an empty object.

### `pressedButton`

- Type: `undefined | { action: "post" | "post_redirect"; index: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 }`

The button that was clicked on the previous frame.

### `buttonIndex`

- Type: `number`

The index of the button that was clicked on the previous frame.

### `message`

- Type: `FrameMessage | undefined`

The frame message that was parsed from the request body.

### `clientProtocol`

- Type: `ClientProtocolId | undefined`

The client protocol that was used to send the frame message.

### `state`

- Type: `JsonValue`

The state extracted from the frame message. If you are on the initial frame (no button pressed), the value is the `initialState` value passed to `createFrames`. If you are on a frame with a button pressed, the value is the state from the previous frame.
