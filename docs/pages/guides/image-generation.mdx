# Images

## Static Images

```tsx
// ...
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    // ...
    image: "https://picsum.photos/seed/frames.js/1146/600",
  };
});
```

## Dynamic Image generation

You can define a dynamic image by passing in a `JSX` element to `image` property. This uses [@vercel/og](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation) library under the hood, which includes a syntax for writing [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You can pass in options for `@vercel/og` via the `imageOptions` property.
There are certain constraints around dynamic images that you should be aware of - firstly, they can be slow, affecting the UX. 
Secondly, dynamic images have a size limit of 256kB, which can easily be crossed if you use an existing image inside of the dynamic image.

```tsx
// ...
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    // ...
    image: (
      <div tw="bg-purple-800 text-white w-full h-full justify-center items-center flex">
        This is rendered as an image
      </div>
    ),
    imageOptions: {
        // ...
    }
  };
});
```

## Using tailwind CSS rules & other quirks

The Image generation uses an experimental tailwind based system, [read their docs on limitations](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation/og-image-examples#using-tailwind-css---experimental).

## Using custom fonts & font-weight

In order to use custom fonts or font weights, you need to load fonts for them in `imageOptions`, [reference docs here](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation/og-image-api).
See a full example using frames.js [here](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/templates/next-starter-with-examples/app/examples/new-api-custom-font).
