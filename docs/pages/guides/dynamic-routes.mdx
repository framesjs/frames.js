# Dynamic Routes

If your frame has a dynamic route segment you can access it in your frame by wrapping it in request.

```tsx
/* eslint-disable react/jsx-key */

import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { frames } from "../frames";
import { Button } from "frames.js/next";

const handler = async (
  req: NextRequest,
  { params: { id } }: { params: { id: string } }
) => {
  return await frames(async (ctx) => {
    return {
      image: <div tw="flex">You are on frame &quot;{id}&quot;.</div>,
      buttons: [
        <Button action="post" target={"/"}>
          ‚Üê Back
        </Button>,
      ],
      title: `Frame ${id}`,
    };
  })(req);
};

export const GET = handler;
export const POST = handler;
```

In the example above, the frame is able to access the dynamic route segment `id` by wrapping it in `request`. This allows the frame to display the current route segment in the frame.
