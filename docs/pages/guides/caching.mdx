# Caching

You can set the caching policy of your frames by defining the `Cache-Control` headers of your frame's **image response**

Since images are returned as an inline Data URL by default, this will require you to create a separate endpoint for your dynamic images that you want to avoid caching for.

```tsx [frames/route.tsx]
// ...
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  return {
    image: "/images/my-image",
    // ...
  };
});
```

```tsx [frames/images/my-image.tsx]
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { ImageResponse } from "@vercel/og";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const imageResponse = new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div tw="bg-purple-800 text-white w-full h-full justify-center items-center flex text-[48px]">
        The current time is {new Date().toLocaleString()}
      </div>
    ),
    { width: 1146, height: 600 }
  );

  // Set the cache control headers to ensure the image is not cached
  imageResponse.headers.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=0");

  return imageResponse;
}
```

Additional context can be passed to the image endpoint via URL query params.

See an example of how to use the `Cache-Control` header in the [Caching example](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/templates/next-starter-with-examples/app/examples/new-api-cache-control).
