# Display Frames in your React Native app

This guide shows you how to use the `@frames.js/render` [Headless UI](/reference/render/headless-ui) to display frames in your React Native app.

## Steps

::::steps

### Install the render package to your app

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @frames.js/render
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @frames.js/render
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @frames.js/render
```

:::

### Add render proxy for routing frame requests via your backend

This helps to protect privacy of your users and prevent CORS issues.

Please follow the instructions in the [Display Frames in React](/guides/apps/display-frames#add-proxies-for-routing-frame-requests-via-your-backend-for-privacy--preventing-cors-issues).

### Set up the `useFrame()` hook

See the [`useFrame()` hook](/reference/render/use-frame) documentation for more information.

```tsx
// [!include ~/snippets/guides/apps/react-native.tsx]
```

### Add the renderer

See the [Headless UI](/reference/render/headless-ui) documentation for more information about the structure, components and theme.

```tsx
// [!include ~/snippets/guides/apps/react-native-full.tsx]
```

### Done! ðŸŽ‰

## Native Wind Support

If you are using [Native Wind](https://native.wind.org) in your React Native app, you can use the `@frames.js/render` package to render frames in your app with few simple changes.

```tsx
// [!include ~/snippets/guides/apps/react-native-nativewind.tsx]
```

## Proxying images via your backend

It is recommended to proxy images via your backend to preserve user privacy and prevent CORS issues.

See the [Display Frames in React](/guides/apps/display-frames#using-nextjs-image-optimization-for-image-proxying) guide for more information on how to transform frame image URLs before rendering them in your app.
