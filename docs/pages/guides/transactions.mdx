# Transaction Frames

Frames can initiate transactions that apps that integrate Frames can complete, calling back your Frame.

An example snippet can be found below.

```tsx
// ...
buttons: [
  <Button action="tx" target="/txdata" post_url="/frames">
    Buy a unit
  </Button>,
];
```

Use the [Transactions starter](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/templates/next-starter-with-examples/app/examples/new-api-transaction) as a template to build your transaction Frames.

## Using the connected wallet address

The client will include the user's connected wallet address that will be executing the transaction in the frame action payload in the when a frame button with `action="tx"` set is pressed.

The address is available in the context under the key `connectedAddress`.

Note:

- The address is only available when the user has connected a wallet to the client the frame button pressed is has a `tx` action.
- `connectedAddress` differs from the `requesterVerifiedAddresses` returned by the [`farcasterHubContext`](/middleware/farcaster-hub-context) middleware.

```tsx [./app/frames/tx-data/route.tsx]
import { frames } from "../frames";

export const POST = frames(async (ctx) => {
  if (!ctx.message) {
    throw new Error("No message");
  }

  const userAddress = ctx.message.connectedAddress;

  // Do something with the user's connected address that will be executing the tx

  return txData;
});
```
