# Transaction Frames

Frames can initiate transactions that apps that integrate Frames can complete, calling back your Frame.

An example snippet can be found below.

```tsx
// ...
buttons: [
  <Button action="tx" target="/txdata" post_url="/frames">
    Buy a unit
  </Button>,
];
```

In your `/txdata` route you should handle the request and return transaction data that conforms to the [`TransactionTargetResponse` type](/reference/js/types#reference). The `transaction` helper function can be used to create the transaction data.

```tsx [./app/frames/txdata/route.tsx]
import { frames } from "../frames";
import { transaction } from "frames.js/core";

export const POST = frames(async (ctx) => {
  // Do something with the request data to generate transaction data

  // Create calldata for the transaction using Viem's `encodeFunctionData`
  const myCalldata = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: myContractAbi,
    functionName: "myFunction",
    args: [myArg1, myArg2],
  });

  // Return transaction data that conforms to the correct type
  return transaction({
    chainId: "eip155:10", // OP Mainnet
    method: "eth_sendTransaction",
    params: {
      abi: myContractAbi,
      to: myContractAddress,
      data: calldata,
      value: myValue.toString(),
    },
  });
});
```

Use the [Transactions starter](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/templates/next-starter-with-examples/app/examples/new-api-transaction) as a template to build your transaction Frames.

## Using the connected wallet address

The client will include the user's connected wallet address that will be executing the transaction in the frame action payload in the when a frame button with `action="tx"` set is pressed.

The address is available in the context under the key `connectedAddress`.

Note:

- The address is only available when the user has connected a wallet to the client the frame button pressed is has a `tx` action.
- `connectedAddress` differs from the `requesterVerifiedAddresses` returned by the [`farcasterHubContext`](/middleware/farcaster-hub-context) middleware.

```tsx [./app/frames/txdata/route.tsx]
import { frames } from "../frames";
import { transaction } from "frames.js/core";

export const POST = frames(async (ctx) => {
  if (!ctx.message) {
    throw new Error("No message");
  }

  const userAddress = ctx.message.connectedAddress;

  // Do something with the user's connected address that will be executing the tx

  return transaction(txData);
});
```
