# Shipping your Frame to production

Frames.js works in most javascript frameworks or libraries, and should work out of the box with whereever you would normally deploy those.

We suggest deploying your frames to Vercel, but [Cloudflare Workers](/reference/core/cloudflare-workers), Docker, AWS or other platforms are compatible.

## Ensure you set up the correct `env` variables

Always specify your frame's [`baseUrl`](/reference/core/createFrames#baseurl) in the `createFrames` call to ensure predictible behaviour of your frame buttons. This should be the full url (including https://) of the homepage.

<Callout type="warning">
If the `baseUrl` is not set, button targets will use the request URL's base URL which may not always point to the correct location.
</Callout>

## Vercel Deployments

Run the `vercel` command-line tool from your frame's folder to deploy your frame to vercel.
