# Shipping your Frame to production

Frames.js works in most javascript frameworks or libraries, and should work out of the box with whereever you would normally deploy those.

We suggest deploying your frames to Vercel, but [Cloudflare Workers](/reference/core/cloudflare-workers), Docker, AWS or other platforms are compatible.

## Ensure you set up the correct `env` variables

For the starter, `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST` should be the full url (including https://) of the homepage.

## Vercel Deployments

Run the `vercel` command-line tool from your frame's folder to deploy your frame to vercel.
