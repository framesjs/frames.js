# Local Debugging of your Frames

![](/frames/frame2.png)

The frames.js debugger comes inside the frames.js starter repos and will run automatically when you run your code.
By default it runs on port 3010, at [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2F).

Features
- fully interactive frames
- connect wallet + transactions
- performance analysis
- frame validations
- jump between Frames
- inspect state
- mock hub states
- impersonate a user, or login with a real farcaster signer

## Local Debugger CLI

You can install and run the frames.js debugger independently of your frame, including for frames.js that don't use frames.js via

`npm install -g @frames.js/debugger`

`frames`

## Hosted Debugger

We've provided a [hosted version](https://debugger.framesjs.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fframesjs.org) of the debugger for convenience. Note it won't work with localhost urls without a service like `ngrok`, which is why we recommend running a local debugger.
