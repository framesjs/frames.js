# Open Frames: make frames that work everywhere

[Open Frames](https://github.com/open-frames/standard) is a standard for Frames that work in multiple ecosystems, including Farcaster, XMTP, Lens and others.

You can define your frame as supporting multiple Open Frames compatible protocols by using the [`openframes`](/middleware/openframes) middleware.

```tsx
// ...
import { openframes } from "frames.js/middleware";

const frames = createFrames({
  // ...
  middleware: [
    openframes({
      clientProtocol: {
        id: "my-protocol",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
      handler: {
        isValidPayload: (body: JSON) => {
          // Check if the request body is a valid Open Frames action
          // ...
          return isValid; // true or false
        },
        getFrameMessage: async (body: JSON) => {
          // Parse the data in the request body and return a Frame message
          // ...
          return frameMessage; // { username: "alice" }
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

and access the protocol used to sign the Frame Message via the `clientProtocol` property of the context.

```tsx
// ...
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  if (ctx.clientProtocol === "my-protocol") {
    // ctx.username is available here
  }
  // ...
});
```

## Unauthenticated Frames

Open Frames can be used to create unauthenticated Frames that can be supported by all clients by using the anonymous frames convention, which is built into the openframes middleware.

In order to support unauthenticated frames in your application, simply include `openframes()` without supplying any arguments in your `createFrames` middleware.

```tsx
const frames = createFrames({
  // ...
  middleware: [
    openframes(),
  ],
});
```

This will add `of:accepts:anonymous` to your page metadata. Clients will then be able to send frame POST requests to your handler without needing to sign the payload. Your `frames` handler will receive the `buttonIndex` and optionally `inputText` and `state` in the `ctx` object.

Use the [Multi Protocol starter](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/templates/next-starter-with-examples/app/examples/multi-protocol) as a template to build your Open Frames frames.
