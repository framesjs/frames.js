# Verifying your frame actions

To verify the integrity of frame actions you have to include the additional middleware in your `createFrames` call. For Farcaster frames this would be the [`farcasterHubContext`](/middleware/farcaster-hub-context) middleware.

```tsx
const frames = createFrames({
  // ...
  middleware: [farcasterHubContext()],
});
```

The contents of this verification, including additional context can be accessed via the `message` object.

**If the message is not valid it means that it failed signature verification and should not be trusted**.

```tsx
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  if (!ctx.message.isValid) {
    throw new Error("Invalid Frame");
  }
  // ...
});
```
